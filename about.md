# <cy>Diable all StartPos</c>
Have you ever accidentally deleted all StartPos in your level and regretted it instantly?

This mod makes the "<cr>Delete all StartPos</c>" button only <cj>disable</c> the StartPos.

## <cr>Speacial thanks</c>
- <cb>BlueBlock6</c> showed me how to disable a StartPos in code.
