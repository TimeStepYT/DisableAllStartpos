# Disable all StartPos
A Geometry Dash mod using the [Geode SDK](https://github.com/geode-sdk/geode) that turns the "Delete all StartPos" button into a "Disable all StartPos" button.

This is useful because you can keep your settings and StartPos locations without having to place them back any time you accidentally use the "Delete all StartPos" button.
